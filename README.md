## Correction :

* Changed the initialization of voteCount to 0
* Added a condition to check if sender.voted is false
*  Added proposals[proposal_].voteCount += 1; to increment the vote count of the voted proposal.
* Included the line winningProposal_ = p; within the if-statement to assign the index of the proposal with the highest vote count to winningProposal_
* Added u32 winnerName = proposals[winnerP].name; to retrieve the name of the winning proposal based on the index returned from winningProposal()
